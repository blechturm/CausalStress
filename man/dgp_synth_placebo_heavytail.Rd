\title{Placebo heavy-tail synthetic DGP (sharp null)}
\usage{
dgp_synth_placebo_heavytail(n, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer, number of observations.}

\item{seed}{Optional seed for reproducibility (passed to \code{cs_set_rng()}).}
}
\value{
A synthetic DGP list with df, true_att, true_qst, meta.
}
\description{
Implements the \code{synth_placebo_heavytail} design: baseline outcome with
heavy-tailed noise (0.8 N(0,0.5) + 0.2 Cauchy(0,1)) and sharp-null treatment
effect (Y1 == Y0 pathwise).
