\title{Mildly tilted propensity synthetic DGP for CausalStress}
\usage{
dgp_synth_tilt_mild(n, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer, number of observations.}

\item{seed}{Optional seed for reproducibility (passed to \code{cs_set_rng()}).}
}
\value{
A list with df, true_att, true_qst, and meta following the synthetic
DGP contract.
}
\description{
Implements the \code{synth_tilt_mild} design from the DGP registry. Uses the same
outcome and noise as \code{synth_baseline} but a mildly tilted propensity to
induce covariate shift.
