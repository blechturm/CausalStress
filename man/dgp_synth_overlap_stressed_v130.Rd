dgp_synth_overlap_stressed_v130(
  n,
  seed = NULL,
  include_truth = TRUE,
  oracle_only = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer, number of observations.}

\item{seed}{Optional seed for reproducibility (passed to \code{cs_set_rng()}).}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item df: tibble with columns \code{y}, \code{w}, \code{y0}, \code{y1}, \code{p}, \code{structural_te},
\code{X1}, \code{X2}, \code{X3}, \code{X4}, \code{X5}
\item true_att: numeric scalar (ATT on treated units)
\item true_qst: tibble with columns \code{tau}, \code{value}
\item meta: list with fields \code{dgp_id}, \code{type}, \code{structural_te}
}
}
\description{
Implements the \code{synth_overlap_stressed} design from the DGP registry.
Shares covariates, baseline outcome, treatment effect, and Gaussian noise
with \code{synth_baseline}, but uses a sharper propensity to stress overlap:
p = plogis(3 * X1 + 3 * X2).
}
\details{
\strong{Goal:} Stress-test weighting stability under severe overlap violations.

\strong{Structure:} Same outcomes/noise as \code{synth_baseline}.

\strong{Propensity:} \eqn{p(X) = \mathrm{plogis}(3.0 X_1 + 3.0 X_2)}, intentionally pushing probability mass toward \eqn{0} or \eqn{1}.
