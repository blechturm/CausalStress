\title{Linear outcome regression ATT estimator}
\usage{
est_lm_att(df, tau = cs_tau_oracle, config = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data.frame or tibble containing at least \code{y}, \code{w}, and at
least one covariate column whose name starts with \code{"X"}. Typically
this is \code{dgp$df} from a synthetic DGP.}

\item{tau}{Numeric vector of quantile levels. Included for interface
compatibility; ignored by this estimator.}

\item{config}{List of estimator-specific settings. Currently unused
but stored in the returned metadata.}
}
\value{
A list with components \code{att}, \code{qst}, \code{cf}, and \code{meta},
satisfying the estimator contract used in CausalStress.
}
\description{
This estimator fits a linear model for the outcome on control units
and then uses g-computation to estimate the ATT. It only uses observed
outcomes \code{y}, treatment indicator \code{w}, and covariates (columns whose
names start with \code{"X"}).
