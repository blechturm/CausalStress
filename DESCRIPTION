Description: A rigorous framework for benchmarking causal inference estimators under
    controlled conditions. It implements a "Constitutional" architecture that enforces
    strict data separation ("Airlocks") between estimators and ground truth, ensuring
    no data leakage. The package features atomic persistence for crash resilience,
    provenance tracking via Git hashes, and a standardized interface for comparing
    estimators across diverse synthetic data-generating processes.
